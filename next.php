							Hello! I'm Jack Anderson and I am currently in my 4th year of study at Edinburgh Napier University for Software Engineering. I have a passion for writing code and learning about new technologies especially to do with artificial intelligence. I'm a huge Linux nerd, I love tinkering and having everything set up to make development a breeze but also because I'm an advocate for open-source software. In my spare time I like to attend hackathons and tech related conferences/talks, collect music and the occasional alchoholic beverage.
